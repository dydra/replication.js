ui involves a description of the process as a layer tree.
the core elements are from the sparql algebra.
these are extended with layrers for ml elements.

the standard operations involve a pull control-flow.
accession operations must also permit an http push to instantiate the process.


a sparql request does that as well, but only to supply the query, not the data
for an import which is to run through some accession filter, it should sufffice to just supply
 the dataset. it should not benecessary to also place a rpocessing request.
 that is, a gsp request should also have a processing side-effect

a GET to a view starts a process which pulls from the sources through the processing tree
a PUT/POST to a view should act on it by supplying a source.
if all sources are supplied, then the view should execute.
